Introduction
DesignDaily is a SwiftUI application that demonstrates modern app architecture using the MVVM pattern, Coordinator pattern, SOLID principles, and Swift's concurrency model with async/await. The app focuses on clean code, scalability, and testability.

Getting Started
Prerequisites
 - Xcode 15 or later
 - Swift 5.9 or later

Setup
 1. Clone the repository using `git clone <repo-url>`.
 2. Open `DesignDaily/DesignDaily.xcodeproj` in Xcode.
 3. Select the `DesignDaily` target and choose a simulator or device.
 4. Build and run the app using **Product > Run** or `Cmd+R`.

Running Tests
 1. In Xcode select **Product > Test** or press `Cmd+U`.
 2. The test suites in `DesignDailyTests` and `DesignDailyUITests` will execute.

Dependencies
  - The project relies solely on SwiftUI and other Apple frameworks. No external packages are required.

Project Overview
The app includes the following features:

User Authentication: Login and Sign-Up screens with validation.
Product Listing: Display a list of products with details.
User Profile: View and edit user profiles.
Settings: Access app settings.
Navigation: Managed using the Coordinator pattern.
Architecture
MVVM Pattern
The Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) pattern separates the app into three layers:

Model: Data structures representing the core data.
View: SwiftUI views responsible for UI rendering.
ViewModel: Handles business logic, data manipulation, and acts as a bridge between the Model and View.
Coordinator Pattern
The Coordinator pattern manages the navigation flow of the application, decoupling navigation logic from the views.

AppCoordinator: Centralizes navigation and routing.
Destination Enum: Defines all possible navigation destinations.
SOLID Principles
The app adheres to the SOLID principles:

Single Responsibility: Each class has one responsibility.
Open/Closed: Classes are open for extension but closed for modification.
Liskov Substitution: Subtypes can replace base types without affecting correctness.
Interface Segregation: Many client-specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface.
Dependency Inversion: Depend on abstractions, not on concrete implementations.
Key Concepts and Implementations
Models

Dependency Injection
Dependencies like services and coordinators are injected into ViewModels via initializers:

init(userService: UserServiceProtocol = UserService(), coordinator: AppCoordinator?) {
    self.userService = userService
    self.coordinator = coordinator
}
Concurrency with async/await
Asynchronous operations are handled using Swift's concurrency model:

func fetchProducts() async {
    isLoading = true
    defer { isLoading = false }
    
    do {
        products = try await productService.fetchProducts()
    } catch {
        errorMessage = error.localizedDescription
    }
}
Testing with Mock Services
Mock services conform to the same protocols as real services and simulate different scenarios for testing.

MockProductService.swift

import Foundation

class MockProductService: ProductServiceProtocol {
    var shouldFail: Bool

    init(shouldFail: Bool = false) {
        self.shouldFail = shouldFail
    }

    func fetchProducts() async throws -> [Product] {
        if shouldFail {
            throw NSError(domain: "TestError", code: 1, userInfo: [NSLocalizedDescriptionKey: "Failed to fetch products"])
        } else {
            return [
                // Return mock products
            ]
        }
    }

    func fetchProductDetails(productId: UUID) async throws -> Product {
        // Implementation
    }
}
State Management in SwiftUI
SwiftUI uses property wrappers to manage state:

@State: Local state within a view.
@Published: Observable properties in a ViewModel.
@StateObject: Instantiates an ObservableObject.
@ObservedObject: Observes an existing ObservableObject.
@EnvironmentObject: Shares data across views via the environment.
Error Handling
Errors are handled using do-catch blocks, and error messages are relayed to the user through the UI.

func login() async {
    isLoading = true
    defer { isLoading = false }
    
    do {
        let user = try await userService.login(email: email, password: password)
        await MainActor.run {
            coordinator?.isAuthenticated = true
        }
    } catch {
        await MainActor.run {
            errorMessage = error.localizedDescription
        }
    }
}
Best Practices
Separation of Concerns: Views handle UI; ViewModels handle logic.
Protocol-Oriented Programming: Use protocols to define interfaces.
Dependency Injection: Inject dependencies to promote testability.
SOLID Principles: Ensure code is maintainable and scalable.
Reusable Components: Create reusable views and components.
Error Handling: Handle errors gracefully and inform the user.
Testing: Write unit tests for ViewModels and services.
